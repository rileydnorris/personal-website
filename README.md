# Website Frontend: rileydnorris.com
[Backend Repository](https://github.com/rileydnorris/rileydnorris.com-backend)

## Description
This is the repository for the frontend code for the website [rileydnorris.com](rileydnorris.com). This is a website to serve as a portfolio for my experience throughout my career. The website will tranform over time to include a full-featured blog where I can expand more on my experiences and what I have learned. More information on this can be found below.

## Roadmap

### Milestone v1
The first milestone is having feature parity with the website [people.tamu.edu/~rileydnorris](people.tamu.edu/~rileydnorris). This site was created by me using HTML for a class project. After completing that project, I decided I wanted a more complete site built in react, and this milestone will be all about catching up to that site. This will mean the site will be 100% complete from the perspective of being a portfolio for me and my experiences.

**Complete list:**
- [ ] Home page with a minimal intro to me and my experiences
- [x] Experiences page with listed work experience and description of career thus far, must include a link to resume as PDF
- [x] Projects page with list of top personal projects and list of top skills
- [x] About me page with a list of hobbies and a few pictures
- [x] Footer containing contact information and links to relevant social media
- [x] CI/CD Pipelin with Docker and Travis CI
- [x] Hosting on AWS at [rileydnorris.com](rileydnorris.com)

### Milestone v2
The second milestone will add a blog with the ability to view past posts. This will allow me to share things of interest to me, as well as more info on my previous expereinces throughout my career.

**Complete list:**
- [ ] Blog page with a list of all previous blog entries
- [ ] Blog detail page with the ability to view a blog post
- [ ] Fully functioning and hosted backend service and database with ability to store blog data

### Milestone v3 & Onward
To be defined as time nears closer, some items include commenting with login system, indepth styling on blog posts, email notifictions, RSS feed, and more.
